# [JSL01] Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

## Overview

The objective of this project was to validate the Syntax function to check if the input string starts with "pet\_" and is followed by a combiantion of letters and numbers. If the input follows the correct syntax, the results were set to 'valid syntax' with a green circle next to it, otherwise, set to 'Invalid' with a red circke bext to it.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

**JavaScript Functionality**:
No mastery as yet, as this is still an introduction to Javascript, but I understood the execution of the syntax correction so well that Inow can say I master using 'if,else' contitional statements.

### Challenges Faced :

I had first added the circles on HTML and they appeared below the results, so I had to put them on my javascript, next to the resutls section so that they can both appear together.

### Areas for Improvement

Practice the whole course to get comfortable using Javascript.

## Overall Learning Experience

I learned regular expressions, which are patterns used to validate strings, helping me enforce specific input formats. I also learned how to incorporate conditional statements to make decisions in code execution based on certain conditions which enhanced my ability to create logic-driven applications.
